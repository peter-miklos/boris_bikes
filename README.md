# Boris Bikes

London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome.
For a small fee, anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.
Bikes are located at Docking Stations dotted throughout the city.
Our project aims to create a software that will manage the network of these Docking Stations.
